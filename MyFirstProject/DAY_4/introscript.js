// Identifiers =>> A name given to an program element (like variable, functions, etc..)
// for ex 
var name = "prem";
let age = 18;
const height = 161.2;
var testPass = true;
// name and age are called Identifiers in programing

// Literals =>> prem : String literals , 18 : integer literal, 161.2 : flostong literals, true : boolean literals.

// group of words = sentence, group of sentence = paragraph
// group of expression = statement, group of statement = program

//e.x let name = prem;

// Expression =>> (name) is a expression , (prem) is a expression. One or more expression called statement.

// Statement =>> One line completed with semicolon called statement =>> e.x let name = prem; One or more statement called Program.

// Coding(var a) = Program(10) =>> var a = 10;
